maximization-hard
reduce it to semidefinite program

we solve the semidefinite programming-linear time
semidefinite  answer is larger than our solution
randomness-> lowerbound

some preconditions/assumptions to shorten work
e.g. non negative edge weights
2 vectors, random hyper plane-> prob that the plane lies between them


outline
gloss over:
  explain max cut, graphical rep
  same as max problem
  relaxation to semidefinite problem-> linear time
randomized part:

experiments
data-> TBD
1 big data to show algo
small data sets to show accuracy

walkthrough coding problem using jupyter notebook
similar to hw 2/4/5
data-> TBD
WIP Ideas
heuristics to simplify code to increase speed?
