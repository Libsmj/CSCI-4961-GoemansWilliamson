CSCI 4961 Machine Learning and Optomization Final Project - Goemans Williamson MAXCUT


"Maxcut Code" contains python code and Matlab code for creating random graphs and finding the maximum cut of the graph

"Maxcut Test Data" Contains graphs from http://biqmac.uni-klu.ac.at/biqmaclib.pdf where the maximum cut is known, and Matlab code for approximating the maxcut of these graphs
    -To run on data, in the function initialize, change the string "g05_60_" to the name of another dataset. For example, to run on the integer [0,10] graphs, change the string to "pw01_100_".

"dataset.ipynb" is a Jupyter workbook for downloading and extracting graphs representing connections on Facebook.
